            <p>I studied for my primary level education in Missions of Hope Centre where I did my KCPE and attained a B+.

             <p>In 2017 I joined the Kiambu Level 4 Hospital Engineering Department as an intern where I stayed for 3 months.

             <h4>My Programming Journey</h4>
    <p>From my career as a BioMedical Engineering Technology I saw how computer grogramming was the drive force of almost all medical machine,
       and as an Engineer I believe it is something I needed to know. I also saw how software engineers are the immediate invetors of this digital
       generation and the field is increasingly providing opportunities for the you. With all this insights and the passion I have for becoming a
       application software developer I seeked an opportunity in Moringa and thnkfully I was given a chnace. And that is where my journey started,
       and is still continuing.
