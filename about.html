                <img src="" alt="picture of me in graduation">
            </div>
            <p>I studied for my primary level education in Missions of Hope Centre where I did my KCPE and attained a B+.
                I Joined Kiambu High School in 2011 and sat for my KCSE and attained a C+. In 2015 I joined Kenya Medical Training College,
                and cleared in 2019 with a diploma in Medical Engineering Technology. 
             </p>

             <h4>Work Experience</h4>
             <p>In 2017 I joined the Kiambu Level 4 Hospital Engineering Department as an intern where I stayed for 3 months. 
                From 2018-2019 I joined Lions SightFirst Eye Hospital as a BioMedical Engineer intern. After My grauation I was hired at

             <h4>My Programming Journey</h4>
    <p>From my career as a BioMedical Engineering Technology I saw how computer grogramming was the drive force of almost all medical machine,
       and as an Engineer I believe it is something I needed to know. I also saw how software engineers are the immediate invetors of this digital
       generation and the field is increasingly providing opportunities for the you. With all this insights and the passion I have for becoming a
       application software developer I seeked an opportunity in Moringa and thnkfully I was given a chnace. And that is where my journey started,
       and is still continuing.
